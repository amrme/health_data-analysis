## Loading and preprocessing the data

* I'm going to load the data from a CSV file into a data frame in the main memory; to perform the rest of the analysis on it.

* I chose to convert it into a data frame in order to make it easy, to use the data with the ggplot2 plotting system.

```{r}
healthData <- read.csv2("./activity.csv", sep = ",")
head(healthData)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

* First I'll help visualize the total number of steps taken each day, using a histogram.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
h <- ggplot(healthData, aes(x = steps)) 
h + geom_histogram()
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
