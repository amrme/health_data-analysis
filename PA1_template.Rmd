## Loading and preprocessing the data

* I'm going to load the data from a CSV file into a data frame in the main memory; to perform the rest of the analysis on it.

```{r}
healthData <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), header = T)
str(healthData)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

* get the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
stepsPerDay <- split(healthData$steps, healthData$date)
#head(stepsPerDay)
```

* First I'll help visualize the total number of steps taken each day, using a histogram.

```{r}
hist(sapply(stepsPerDay, sum, na.rm = T), breaks = 8, 
     main = "Total Number of Steps Per Day",
     xlab = "Days", ylab = "Frequency of Steps")
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
